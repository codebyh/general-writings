PART I “In the Event of Total War Women Will Be Needed”

CHAPTER ONE Twenty-Eight Acres of Girls

In 1942 Dot Braden took a teaching job at Chatham High School, Virginia.  All of the teaching as fallen on her with staff shortage during WWII. Five days a week, eight hours a day, Dot Braden ran from classroom to classroom, teaching, lecturing, grading, marching. For her pains she was paid $900 a year, or about $5 a day. 

In 1943 Dot presented her at the Virginian Hotel to meet war recruiters, war has already taken over the city. She liked the idea of working in washington and doing her part. A few weeks later she received a litter to work as a civilian for the U.S. Army Signal Intelligence Service, she would be paid $1620 a year. She travelled to Washington and took loyality oath and secrecy oat regarding her new duties. She had to find a place to live.She found residence in Arlington Farms, Washington, which was becoming to known as Girl Town and "28 Acres of Girls".It was built to house seven thousand female war workers. 

Dot was introduced to "cryptography" in the orientation days and received strict lecture about need for absolute secrecy. She was hired to break enemy codes. Women here attacking enemy messages pouring in via airmail, cabke and teletype. American operators further encrypted them sing their own encoding machine. Once they got to Arlington Hall, the messages had to be stripped of the American encryption before they could be stripped of the underlying enemy encryption. Technically, Arlington Hall was a military base, known as Arlington Hall Station. 

Code breaking required literacy, numeracy, care, creativity, painstaking attention to detail, a good memory and a willingness to hazard guesses. Hobbies, temperament, tolerance to drudgery, a boundless reserve of energy and optimism were some charactertics of good code breakers. This description fit many school teachers, including Dot Barden, to a T. 

Dot was put to work sorting messages, a common first assignment. She now then presented with a series of four-digit numbers and told to discern any pattern she might see. Dot did not find the work easy; it felt like a complicated puzzle, but she must have done all right, as she presently was told that she was being moved on to the next level. Dot Braden was assigned to Department K of Section B-II of Arlington Hall. She had been assigned to one of the most urgent missions that Arlington Hall had undertaken: breaking the codes that were being used to direct merchant ships moving around distant Pacific islands. The ships were bringing vital supplies to Japanese Army troops. Dot would be cracking the messages that controlled—and foretold—their movements.

CHAPTER TWO “This Is a Man’s Size Job, but I Seem to Be Getting Away with It”

Codes have been around for as long as civilization, maybe longer. Virtually as soon as humans developed the ability to speak and write, somebody somewhere felt the desire to say something to somebody else that could not be understood by others. The point of a coded message is to engage in intimate, often urgent communication with another person and to exclude others from reading or listening in. It is a system designed to enable communication and to prevent it.

Around 1916, Elizebeth Smith and William Friedman  worked for an eccentric bussiness man named George Fabyan. They led a team that performed code and cipher work for the government in Washington. In 1921, both of them were hired by the Army to disguise military communications and they moved to Washington.
