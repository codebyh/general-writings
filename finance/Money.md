## Money
> You either master the money, or, on some level, money masters you.
- If you work for a living, you're trading your time for money. It could the *worst trade you can make*. Why? You can always get more money, but you can't get more time.
- Contrary to popular wisdom, knowledge is not power - it's *potential* power. Knowledge is not mastery. Execution is mastery. Execution will trump knowledge every day of the week. 
- Build a money machine that will make money when you sleep.
- You are not after money but what you think money is going to give you. Ultimately, it's a set of feelings. And beneath those feeling are needs: 
    - Needs of Personality, all try to fulfill these
        - need for certainty or comfort: to feel in control and secure. Our need for certainty is survival mechanism. It affects how much risk we're willing to take in life - in our jobs, in our investments, and in our relationships. The higher the need for certainty, the less risk you'll be willing to take or emotionally bear.
        - need for variety or uncertainty: we need variety, we need surprises. You like surprises you want and you call the rest as problems.
        - need to be significant: to feel important, special, unique or needed.
        - need for love and connection: to feel alive. You can get it through intimacy, or friendship, or prayer, or walking in nature.
    - Needs of the spirit, these are more rare
        - need for growth: can be relationships or business
        - need to contribute: secret to living is giving
    the feeling of empowerment, of freedom, of security, of helping those we love and those in need, of having a choice, and of feeling alive.

# Financial Myths

### Myth 1: "Invest with us. We'll beat the market"
- An incredible 96% of actively managed mutual funds fail to beat the market (i.e stock index S&P 500) over any sustained period of time. 
### Myth 2: "Our Fees? They're a small price to pay"
- The average cost of owning a mutual fund is 3.17% per year.
- The worse part, you put up the capital, you took all the risk, and fund managers make money no matter what happens.

# 7 steps to Financial Freedom

## Step 1
> Earn more, spend less and automate it! 

- Save a portion or percentage of your paycheck i.e _**pay yourself first**_, before you spend a single dollar on day-to-day living expenses. This enables to always have money in the future. Aim for atleast 10%. 
- Make your savings _**automatic**_. Once you don't see the money coming in, you'll be suprised how many ways you find to adjust your spending.
- Take advantage of power of compounding by choosing right investment plan.
