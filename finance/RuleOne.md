Guide to return 15% or more in the stock market, with almost no returns. 
In 1906 the Dow Jones Industrial Average - a key index of the stock market's rise and fall - hit 100.
In 1942 it was also at 100. In other words, if you bought a diversified portfolio of stocks anytime from 1906 to 1942, your rate of return was zero or worse (most likely worse).

3 Major influences of the market in last 20 years:
1. The impact of institutional money, such as mutual funds, pension funds, and insurance funds. 
2. The impact of Efficient market theory
3. the impact of the Internet and personal computers on the ordinary individual's capacity to access information cheaply and use it to his advantage. 

Chapter 1: The Myths of Investing
The three myths of investing:
1. You have to be an expert to manage money : with internet and tools alot of information is available to individual investors. All that is required is a little instruction and brief learning period. 
2. You can't beat the market: Some people do beat the market for long periods, all follow Rule #1. Efficient Market Theory (EMT) says in general and the stock market in particular is efficient i.e they price things according to their value. Buffets quips that he hopes the business schools will continue to turn out fund managers who believe in EMT so that he'll continue to have lots of misinformed fund managers to buy business from when they price them too cheap, and to sell business when they're willing to pay too much. You can take advantage of regular mispricing to reap a 15% return or more.
3. The best way to minimize risk is to diversify and hold (for long term): If you know how to invest - meaning you understand Rule #1 and know how to find a wonderful company at an attractive price then you do not diversify your money into 50 stocks or an index mutual fund. You focus on few business you understand. You buy when the big guys, the fund managers who control the market are fearful, and you sell when they're greedy. More than 80% of the money in the market is invested by institutional money (fund managers). In other words, the fund managers are the market, when they move billions of dollars into a stock, the price of the stock goes up. When they take their money out, the price of that stock goes down. Their effect on the market is so huge that if they decide to sell suddenly, they can generate a massive crash. Understanding this fact is central to Rule #1: The fund managers control the price of almost all the stocks in the market, but they can't easily get out when they want to. Individual investor can be in and out of the market within seconds. Buy a dollar for 50 cents, and sell it later for a dollar. Repeat until very rich. 

Chapter 2: Rule #1 and the Four Ms
Rule #1 in a Nutshell
Rule #1 literally means "Don't Lose Money". In investment it means to invest with certainty. Certainty comes from buying a wonderful business at an attractive price. 

Rule #1 investing in four straightforward steps:
1. Find a wonderful business
2. Know what it's worth as a business
3. Buy it at 50% (be a good shopper, the price of a thing is NOT always equal to its value)
4. Repeat until very rich

The FOUR Ms
1. Meaning: Know what the business does and be confident it operates from a set of values you feel comfortable with. 
2. Moat: Business should be able to defend itself against attacks by competitors. Be able to accurately predict the business's long term future. 
3. Management: People running the business are doing with long term growth. 
4. Margin of Safety: Know the value of business and can get it on a sale. In other words, you'd be able to buy this business cheap enough that you can sell it later without losing money - even if you were wrong to buy it in the first place. 

Chapter 3: Buy a Business, Not a stock

Chapter 4: Identify a Moat
Does the business have a wide Moat?
Understand if the future is predictable with high certainty. As a rule #1 investor, you don't buy a company with uncertain future.  

Idea of the Moat is really simple. If an industry looks as if it might be very easy to get into, there probably isn't a Moat. Example: Commodity (fruits, vegetables) business don't have Moats. We don't want to own business without Moats because it's really hard to make money. Wide moat means the business is very hard to compete against and also they keep up with inflation, example: Coke-cola and pepsi, Gillette, Disney, Wrigley, starbucks, Apple. 

Moat's aren't always about loving the product. Example: people hate windows but still use as it has huge library, people might wal-mart but still use it as the products are really cheap. 

Moats can be created by trade secrets that keeps other business from copying them. Example: cooke-cola, Pfizer, Intel, PG&E (protected by government law, to provide utility in its region), toll bridges, advertising and Media companies, 

Overall, Moat gives some kind of Monopolistic position and the business is well known for being number one or two in its industry. 

Five moats
| TYPE        | DEFINITION           | EXAMPLE  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| Brand     | a product you're willing to pay more for because you trust it | Coke, Gillette, Disney, McDonald's, Pepsi, Nike, Budweiser, Harley-Davidson |
| Secret     | a business that has a patent or trade secret that makes direct competition illegal or very difficult | Pfizer, 3M, Intel |
| Toll | a business with exclusive control of a market - giving it the ability to collect a "toll" from anyone needing that service or product | Media companies, utilities, ad agencies|
| Switching | a business that's so much a part of your life that switching isn't worth the trouble | ADP, Paychex, H&R Block, Microsoft |
| Price | a business that can price products so low no one can compete | Wal-mart, Costco, Bed Bath & Beyond, Home Depot, Target |

The Big-FIVE
If a business has at least one of the Five Moats, it'll show up in the Big Five numbers:
1. Return on Investment Capital (ROIC)
2. Sales growth rate
3. Earnings per share (EPS) growth rate
4. Equity, or Book Value per Share (BVPS), growth rate
5. Free Cash flow (FCF or Cash) growth rate

All the Big Five should be equal to or greater than 10% per for last 10 years.
