Guide to return 15% or more in the stock market, with almost no returns.

Chapter 1: The Myths of Investing
The three myths of investing:
1. You have to be an expert to manage money : with internet and tools alot of information is available to individual investors. All that is required is a little instruction and brief learning period. 
2. You can't beat the market: Some people do beat the market for long periods, all follow Rule #1. Efficient Market Theory (EMT) says in general and the stock market in particular is efficient i.e they price things according to their value. Buffets quips that he hopes the business schools will continue to turn out fund managers who believe in EMT so that he'll continue to have lots of misinformed fund managers to buy business from when they price them too cheap, and to sell business when they're willing to pay too much. You can take advantage of regular mispricing to reap a 15% return or more.
3. The best way to minimize risk is to diversify and hold (for long term): If you know how to invest - meaning you understand Rule #1 and know how to find a wonderful company at an attractive price then you do not diversify your money into 50 stocks or an index mutual fund. You focus on few business you understand. You buy when the big guys, the fund managers who control the market are fearful, and you sell when they're greedy. More than 80% of the money in the market is invested by institutional money (fund managers). In other words, the fund managers are the market, when they move billions of dollars into a stock, the price of the stock goes up. When they take their money out, the price of that stock goes down. Their effect on the market is so huge that if they decide to sell suddenly, they can generate a massive crash. Understanding this fact is central to Rule #1: The fund managers control the price of almost all the stocks in the market, but they can't easily get out when they want to. Individual investor can be in and out of the market within seconds. Buy a dollar for 50 cents, and sell it later for a dollar. Repeat until very rich.
