Guide to return 15% or more in the stock market, with almost no returns. 
In 1906 the Dow Jones Industrial Average - a key index of the stock market's rise and fall - hit 100.
In 1942 it was also at 100. In other words, if you bought a diversified portfolio of stocks anytime from 1906 to 1942, your rate of return was zero or worse (most likely worse).

3 Major influences of the market in last 20 years:
1. The impact of institutional money, such as mutual funds, pension funds, and insurance funds. 
2. The impact of Efficient market theory
3. the impact of the Internet and personal computers on the ordinary individual's capacity to access information cheaply and use it to his advantage. 

Chapter 1: The Myths of Investing
The three myths of investing:
1. You have to be an expert to manage money : with internet and tools alot of information is available to individual investors. All that is required is a little instruction and brief learning period. 
2. You can't beat the market: Some people do beat the market for long periods, all follow Rule #1. Efficient Market Theory (EMT) says in general and the stock market in particular is efficient i.e they price things according to their value. Buffets quips that he hopes the business schools will continue to turn out fund managers who believe in EMT so that he'll continue to have lots of misinformed fund managers to buy business from when they price them too cheap, and to sell business when they're willing to pay too much. You can take advantage of regular mispricing to reap a 15% return or more.
3. The best way to minimize risk is to diversify and hold (for long term): If you know how to invest - meaning you understand Rule #1 and know how to find a wonderful company at an attractive price then you do not diversify your money into 50 stocks or an index mutual fund. You focus on few business you understand. You buy when the big guys, the fund managers who control the market are fearful, and you sell when they're greedy. More than 80% of the money in the market is invested by institutional money (fund managers). In other words, the fund managers are the market, when they move billions of dollars into a stock, the price of the stock goes up. When they take their money out, the price of that stock goes down. Their effect on the market is so huge that if they decide to sell suddenly, they can generate a massive crash. Understanding this fact is central to Rule #1: The fund managers control the price of almost all the stocks in the market, but they can't easily get out when they want to. Individual investor can be in and out of the market within seconds. Buy a dollar for 50 cents, and sell it later for a dollar. Repeat until very rich. 

Chapter 2: Rule #1 and the Four Ms
Rule #1 in a Nutshell
Rule #1 literally means "Don't Lose Money". In investment it means to invest with certainty. Certainty comes from buying a wonderful business at an attractive price. 

Rule #1 investing in four straightforward steps:
1. Find a wonderful business
2. Know what it's worth as a business
3. Buy it at 50% (be a good shopper, the price of a thing is NOT always equal to its value)
4. Repeat until very rich

The FOUR Ms
1. Meaning: Know what the business does and be confident it operates from a set of values you feel comfortable with. 
2. Moat: Business should be able to defend itself against attacks by competitors. Be able to accurately predict the business's long term future. 
3. Management: People running the business are doing with long term growth. 
4. Margin of Safety: Know the value of business and can get it on a sale. In other words, you'd be able to buy this business cheap enough that you can sell it later without losing money - even if you were wrong to buy it in the first place. 

Chapter 3: Buy a Business, Not a stock
Does the business have 'Meaning' to you ? implies two questions
1. Do you want to own the whole business?
2. Do you understand it well to own it all?
Think like business owner and not stock owner. 

Select 5-10 you like the best.As a Rule #1 investors, we're going to own only a few businesses. Since that's the case, we must prepare ourselves to be certain we own the right few businesses - businesses that don't lose our money. 

The 10-10 Rule: I won't own this business for ten minutes unless I'm willing to own it for ten years.

Chapter 4: Identify a Moat
Does the business have a wide Moat?
Understand if the future is predictable with high certainty. As a rule #1 investor, you don't buy a company with uncertain future.  

Idea of the Moat is really simple. If an industry looks as if it might be very easy to get into, there probably isn't a Moat. Example: Commodity (fruits, vegetables) business don't have Moats. We don't want to own business without Moats because it's really hard to make money. Wide moat means the business is very hard to compete against and also they keep up with inflation, example: Coke-cola and pepsi, Gillette, Disney, Wrigley, starbucks, Apple. 

Moat's aren't always about loving the product. Example: people hate windows but still use as it has huge library, people might wal-mart but still use it as the products are really cheap. 

Moats can be created by trade secrets that keeps other business from copying them. Example: cooke-cola, Pfizer, Intel, PG&E (protected by government law, to provide utility in its region), toll bridges, advertising and Media companies, 

Overall, Moat gives some kind of Monopolistic position and the business is well known for being number one or two in its industry. 

Five moats
| TYPE        | DEFINITION           | EXAMPLE  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| Brand     | a product you're willing to pay more for because you trust it | Coke, Gillette, Disney, McDonald's, Pepsi, Nike, Budweiser, Harley-Davidson |
| Secret     | a business that has a patent or trade secret that makes direct competition illegal or very difficult | Pfizer, 3M, Intel |
| Toll | a business with exclusive control of a market - giving it the ability to collect a "toll" from anyone needing that service or product | Media companies, utilities, ad agencies|
| Switching | a business that's so much a part of your life that switching isn't worth the trouble | ADP, Paychex, H&R Block, Microsoft |
| Price | a business that can price products so low no one can compete | Wal-mart, Costco, Bed Bath & Beyond, Home Depot, Target |

The Big-FIVE
If a business has at least one of the Five Moats, it'll show up in the Big Five numbers:
1. Return on Investment Capital (ROIC)
2. Sales growth rate
3. Earnings per share (EPS) growth rate
4. Equity, or Book Value per Share (BVPS), growth rate
5. Free Cash flow (FCF or Cash) growth rate

All the Big Five should be equal to or greater than 10% per for last 10 years. 

Chapter 5: The Big Five Numbers
*Return on Investment Capital (ROIC)* is a rate of return a business makes on the cash it invests in itself every year. It's a measure of how effectively a company uses the money (borrowed or owned) invested in its operations. As such, it's also an  indicator of how effectively a company's Management team is at using the money invested in its operations. 
Example: Lemonade stand takes $200 and earns $300. Profit = $100, ROIC = 100/200 = 50% return. 

We want to see a long history of great ROIC - at least 10% per year for the last 10 year's average. And we don't want to see ROIC going down, we want to see it *going up or at least staying the same*.  while it's acceptable to just focus on the 10 year average, it's best to look at three numbers for ROIC:
(1) the 10-year average
(2) the past 5 years average
(3) the last year's average
Having all three ROIC numbers gives a better sense of how a company is doing. 

The FOUR Growth Rates
We also need to know that the business is growing for the benefit of us, the owners. These numbers tell us how much the business is growing each year over the previous year and, if they are consistent, give us a huge clue to what rate of growth we should expect in the future. This is critical to figuring out what this business is worth today.

For that information, we have to look at four growth rates: 
(1) sales growth rate
Sales are the total dollars the business took in from selling whatever widgets and digits it sells. Also referred to as "top line" (number) as it's located on the top line in financial reports about the business (specifically, on the income statement).
Example: Lemonade stand make $1000 of sales in Year-2. Sales grew from $300 to $1000, rate = 1000/300 = 3.33 => this means sales were same (first 1) + we get another 2.33 or 233% growth rate. If year-5 sales are $3000, sales grew from $1000 to $3000, rate = 3000/1000 = 3.0 => 1 + 2 or 20% growth rate [??? 25%]

(2) earnings per share (EPS) growth rate
EPS tells us how much the business is profiting per share of ownership. 
Example: To expand lemonade stand we will need more supplies to keep up with demand. we need outside money and to get the money we need to sell some ownership. We need to make lemonade stand business into a corporation so we can create lots of little pieces of ownership in business. Those pieces are called shared of stock. Once this is done, we will have stock to sell people. We can decide to issue 2,000 shares. It can also be 10,000 or a million. That doesn't change the size of pie - but create more pieces.

Next we need to figure out what the business is worth so we know what to charge for a piece of it. For 5 years business has been growing fast - at about 25% per year. Last year earnings were $2,000. If this was a public traded company with high track record investors would pay 2x growth rate i.e 50 times * (last year earnings) = $100,000 to own a piece of business. But since lemonade stand is not big or public, it isn't worth much to private investor as it involves to many risks making the business worth quarter of that like $25,000. Now if we want to sell 50% of the business it will be $12,500. If issued stock was 2,000 we sell half of it. cost per share = $12,500/1000 = $12.50. The other 1,000 shares are owned by us, representing half the ownership of the business. 

Now we can use $12,500 (invest capital) + $2,000 (cash surplus from earnings) we put use it to grow business to a point where it generates $6,000 in earnings per year. This is divided among total shares of 2,000 i.e $6,000/2,000 shares = $3 EPS. 

EPS is often called the "the bottom line" because it's usually the last line on the financial statement.  EPS growth rate is the amount of growth from one year to another expressed in %. 
Example: 10 years ago lemonade EPS was 10 cents  ($200/2000 shares) and today is $3 per share growth rate = (present value - past value)/ past value = (3 - 0.10)/0.10 = 29% [??? 41%] per year

In this amount we want to know if owners get to keep that money or whether it's getting spend on a bunch of equipment to create next year's spectacular growth. For this we need to look at equity growth rate. 

(3) equity growth rate
Equity is what is left over once we (us and other other business owners) have sold off everything, paid off any debt, and took the money that was left. 
Example: when we decided to sell lemonade stand but nobody wanted to buy it from us. we sell the supplies $8,000 (sugar, lemons, machines etc) + couple of trucks (worth $10,000) + cash ($10,000) = $28,000 of equity (also called book value or liquidation value). This is split on per share basic = $28,000/2,000 shares = $14 is called Book value per share (BVPS).

Equity numbers are vastly different for factory type business (like McDonalds) vs intellectual or knowledge business (like Google). *But the rate of equity growth could be identical.* It tells us the business can accumulate surplus (can be used to increase its market or develop new products. Not just to maintain the business though.), and that in itself makes it exceptional. Hence, equity alone isn't nearly as revealing as equity growth rate. 

Equity, or book value per share, is also an excellent indicator of the long-term growth of what Mr.Buffets calls *intrinsic value* or what is referred in the book as "Sticker Price", the rational value of business. We look at equity growth rate to help determine the long-term growth rate, and thus the sticker price, of a business. 

Example: Back when we sold stock in lemonade business, equity = $12,500 (1,000 shares sold) + $2,000 (earnings) = $14,500.  BVPS = $14,500/2,000 = $7.25. If we liquidate the business today after 5 years = $28,000/2000 = $14 BVPS. equity Growth rate for last 5 years = 14% per year [???]

Other terms: Diluted Normalized EPS, Diluted EPS
(4) free cash growth rate
Cash tells us if company's cash is aligned with its profits. Cash growth, in particular, tells us whether its cash is growing with its profits or if the profits are only on paper. We like *real* cash growth.

Example: lemonade business has some machinery and trucks. so any profits need be reinvested in expensive hardware which becomes worthless. If business makes profit, almost all of it becomes cash in the bank. That cash can be used for business purpose, or it can be given to the owners as a so-called dividend.
5 years ago lemonade had $1,000 in cash and today it has $10,000. cash growth rate = 58% [???]

A dividend is a pay-out of extra cash the business can't use effectively to grow. The author prefers business that can invest the cash for him instead of giving back to him and making him reinvest himself.

What about Debt?
Debt is more of an after thought than one of the Big Five. 
A business that is carrying alot of debt *relative* to its income has an unpredictable financial future. 
Zero debt is best, but if you can pay off the debt in one year of free cash flow, then debt load is good.We'll set maximum payoff time at 3-years. After that, we are not interested. 

Others ways to evaluate debt is to see it as percentage of the equity and the liabilities or just the equity i.e debt/equity ratio. But business can manipulated these ratio for lots of good and bad reasons.

All you need to find out is company's total long-term debt and its current free cash flow. Look for numbers (it will be in millions) not the percentages. Don't worry much about short term debt, long-term debt is what you want to watch out for and you'll find it on the balance sheet as simply "Long term debt".

Example: Divide business long term debt by its current cash flow. Debt = $923 and cash flow = $304 so 923/304 = 3 (barely ok)

Dividends
Every year business has left over cash, CEO gets to decide whether to give it to us or spend it on R&D, expand employees, build stores, marketing etc. If CEO doesn't give it back to us we want him/her to get a high return on investment for our money. As long as *ROIC* is staying up there, a good job is being done. 

When a business can't use the excess cash to grow any faster (eg: Microsoft), it gets paid out to owners as dividends. Some companies use all the earnings to grow and so they don't pay dividend (eg: starbucks). *As Rule #1 investors, we don't exclude a business because it pays (or doesn't pay) a dividend. Paying a dividend is not a indication of slow growth or fast growth.* It's just a choice being made by management about how best to manage the owner's cash. 

A bad dividend is one that's paid out with the money the CEO could have used to grow the business. This can be done to keep consistent dividend payouts, but not good for business in long term. 

Dividends and Equity Growth:
Dividends are deducted from equity. Most companies pay dividends more or less a constant % of surplis, hence we need to add the dividends back to the equity before calculating the equity growth rate. 
When huge dividends are made the equity will drop heavily, check out the cash flow to see if there any big payouts. 

Chapter 6: Calculate the Big Five
Rule of 72 -> using compound interest an approximate time to double the money, divide 72/(interest rate)
Example: $10,000 will be doubled (aprrox) in 72/8% interest rate in 9 years

By hand calculation for all 4 Growth rates:
A business values goes from 36 to 130 in 7 years, what is the growth rate?
step 1: Count number to times in got double 40 (approx of 36) -> 80 [once] -> 160 [twice]. 
step 2: Get years from #1 factor. 130 quite not close to 160, so it took 7 years/ factor 2 =  3.5 - 4 year to become double
step 2: 72/4 = 18% growth rate

A business values goes from 102 to 763 in 9 years, what is the growth rate?
step 1: Count number to times in got double 100 (approx of 102) -> 200 [once] -> 400 [twice] -> 800 [thrice]. 
step 2: Get years from #1 factor. so it took 9 years/factor 3 = 3 years to become double
step 2: 72/3 = 24% growth rate

Priority of Growth Rates:
Not all four growth rates bear the same weight, or share the same level of importance. Although they all should be above our 10% minimum, here's the order of importance (starting with most important):
(1) Equity Growth
(2) EPS Growth
(3) Sales (or gross profit) growth
(4) Cash flow growth

Equity and EPS growth rate say a lot about the future of the company, and how certain we can be about the future of the company, and how certain we can be in predicting that future, which is corner stone to Rule #1. 

Calculating ROIC:
The most important number of all. Rule of 72 won't work for ROIC but it can be easily found on an financial site.
ROIC = NOPAT (net operating profit after tax)/(equity + debt)
NOPAT = net income from operations + interest + depreciation expenses

Moat: Overall look for consistency and minimum of above 10% in the priority of Big 5 numbers (ROIC + 4 growth rates).

How reliable is past growth in predicting the future?
Just because the Big-5 were good in the past doesn't always mean they'll be good in the future. Almost every business ends it long streak of great Big-5 at some point (runs of people to sell their good & services, competition takes over etc). Maybe the entire industry becomes absolute. Past growth rates alone are not good enough to predict the future. Which is why Rule #1 investors don't rely on past growth rates to make a prediction. Remember the first M: *meaning* to you. Do not invest your retirement money in anything you don't understand and has no meaning to on some level. 


Summary: we are looking at stocks as business. we're looking for a wonderful business and we're insisting we buy it at an attractive price. Having a wide Moat is critical part of a wonderful business, because a wide-Moat business can recover from from lots of disasters.

Chapter 7 : Bet on the Jockey
Third M : *Management*
We are looking for a leader. Someone who is going to take our company to the moon.Someone who lives and breathes this company. Someone who has a Big Audacious Goal that he wants to drive the business to achieve. 

How Venture Capitalist Gamble Smartly
Venture capitalists (VC) invest in companies before the firms offer their stock to the general public. It hard work and risky. VC is all about investing at such an early stage that you can't really be certain it's all going to work. There are no Big-5 numbers to look at, sometimes if it is new there is no industry. Hence VCs bet on management team (bet on jockey) at least as much as they did on the business plan. One of the main reason you want to own a business is because you like and trust the people who run it. Sometimes VCs hold up funding until a great CEO can be found to join the team. Top of their essentials a business must have - a CEO they trust and with whom they want to work. 

Who are we looking for:
CEO's who move their companies to greatness are called "Level-5" leaders. Most important qualities are:
1. Owner - Oriented 
2. Driven

An Owner-Oriented CEO
An owner oriented CEO is one who has his personal interest directly aligned with the shareholders of the business - the owners.
