Deep Work: Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate.

Shallow Work: Non-cognitively demanding, logistical-style tasks, often performed while distracted. These efforts tend to not create much new value in the world and are easy to replicate.

The ability to perform deep work is becoming increasingly rare at exactly the same time it is becoming increasingly valuable in our economy. As a consequence, the few who cultivate this skill, and then make it the core of their working life, will thrive. 

Part One: The Idea

Chapter 1: Deep Work is valuable
To do well in current economy there are 2 factors needed:
(i). Micro: in scope and focus on the personality traits and tactics
(ii). Macro: less on the individuals and more on the type of work they represent.

The unprecedented growth and impact of technology are creating a massive restructuring of our economy. In this new economy, three groups will have a particular advantage:
1. The High-Skilled Workers: those who can work well and creatively with intelligent
machines
2. The Superstars: those who are the best at what they do
3. The Owners: those with access to capital 

Two Core Abilities for Thriving in the New Economy:
1. The ability to quickly master hard things:
Here it is not the ability to easily use drop-dead-simple user experience of many consumer facing technologies. To join the group of those who can work well with these machines, therefore, requires that you hone your ability to master hard things. And because these technologies change rapidly, this process of mastering hard things never ends: You must be able to do it quickly, again and again.
2. The ability to produce at an elite level, in terms of both quality and speed:
If you want to become a superstar, mastering the relevant skills is necessary, but not sufficient. You must then transform that latent potential into tangible results that people value.If you don’t produce, you won’t thrive—no matter how skilled or talented you are.
