Deep Work: Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate.

Shallow Work: Non-cognitively demanding, logistical-style tasks, often performed while distracted. These efforts tend to not create much new value in the world and are easy to replicate.

The ability to perform deep work is becoming increasingly rare at exactly the same time it is becoming increasingly valuable in our economy. As a consequence, the few who cultivate this skill, and then make it the core of their working life, will thrive. 

Part One: The Idea

Chapter 1: Deep Work is valuable
To do well in current economy there are 2 factors needed:
(i). Micro: in scope and focus on the personality traits and tactics
(ii). Macro: less on the individuals and more on the type of work they represent.

The unprecedented growth and impact of technology are creating a massive restructuring of our economy. In this new economy, three groups will have a particular advantage:
1. The High-Skilled Workers: those who can work well and creatively with intelligent
machines
2. The Superstars: those who are the best at what they do
3. The Owners: those with access to capital 

Two Core Abilities for Thriving in the New Economy (and to perform deep work):
1. The ability to quickly master hard things:
Here it is not the ability to easily use drop-dead-simple user experience of many consumer facing technologies. To join the group of those who can work well with these machines, therefore, requires that you hone your ability to master hard things. And because these technologies change rapidly, this process of mastering hard things never ends: You must be able to do it quickly, again and again.
2. The ability to produce at an elite level, in terms of both quality and speed:
If you want to become a superstar, mastering the relevant skills is necessary, but not sufficient. You must then transform that latent potential into tangible results that people value.If you don’t produce, you won’t thrive—no matter how skilled or talented you are.

*Deep Work Helps You Quickly Learn Hard Things*
To learn requires intense concentration. The differences between expert performers and normal adults reflect a life-long period of *deliberate effort* to improve performance in a specific domain.
what deliberate practice actually requires? Its core components are usually identified as follows: 
(1) your attention is focused tightly on a specific skill you’re trying to improve or an idea you’re trying to master;
(2) you receive feedback so you can correct your approach to keep your attention exactly
where it’s most productive.

*Deep Work Helps You Produce at an Elite Level*
By consolidating the work into intense and uninterrupted pulses, you can leverage the following law of productivity:
    High-Quality Work Produced = (Time Spent) x (Intensity of Focus)

Attention residue: when you switch from some Task A to another Task B, your attention doesn’t immediately follow—a residue of your attention remains stuck thinking about the original task. This residue gets especially thick if your work on Task A was unbounded and of low intensity before you switched, but even if you finish Task A before moving on, your attention remains divided for a while.

People experiencing attention residue after switching tasks are likely to demonstrate poor performance on that next task and the more intense the residue, the worse the performance.

To produce at your peak level you need to work for extended periods with full concentration on a single task free from distraction. Put another way, the type of work that optimizes your performance is deep work.

Note: If you’re a high-level executive
at a major company, you probably don’t need the advice in the pages that follow. In addition to executives, we can also include, for example, certain types of salesmen and lobbyists, for whom constant connection is their most valued currency.
We must continually remember, certain corners of our economy where depth is not valued.

Put another way: Deep work is not the only skill valuable in our economy, and it’s possible to do well without fostering this ability, but the niches where this is advisable are increasingly rare. Unless you have strong evidence that distraction is important for your specific profession, you’re best served, for the reasons argue earlier in this chapter, by giving serious consideration to depth.

Chapter 2: Deep Work is Rare
The recent business trends are open work spaces, instant messaging, social media presence. Many other ideas are being prioritized as more important than deep work in the business world, such as, serendipitous collaboration, rapid communication,and an active presence on social media. Many of these trends actively decrease one’s ability to go deep.
